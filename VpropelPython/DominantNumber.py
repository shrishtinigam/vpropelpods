"""Given two numbers print the dominant number. A number is said to be dominant over the other if the sum of proper factors 
of the number is greater than the sum of proper factors of the other. Factors of a number excluding 1 and itself are called 
proper factors. Print 'No dominance' when the sum of the proper factors are same."""
